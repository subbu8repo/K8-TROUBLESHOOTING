These are used when which pod have to deployed on which nodes and similarly which nodes should avoid certain pods to be schedule on them , which k8s nodes should become unschedublable for all the pod during the
backsups or upgrades
Node Selector is a simple way to constrain pods to nodes with specific labels. It allows you to specify a set of key-value pairs that must match the node's labels for a pod to be scheduled on that node.
for example lets say a pod running a application which will only works which will run only on arm processor linux machine or with AMD processor or on only windows machine now you want your pod to schedule only on 
node with arm processor
so i will put node selector label which will tell the kube scheduler only schedule on node which has the label called which ever mention in the node-name. 
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: web-nginx
spec: 
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: my-app
  template: 
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: my-app
    spec: 
      nodeSelector:
        node-name: arm-worker
      containers:
      - name: nginx-image
        image: subbu8docker/recharge:latest
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
        resources:
          limits:
            cpu: "250m"
            memory: "300Mi"
before this i will make sure one or 2 or certain nodes have arm processor and i add label name by 
kubectl edit node nodename
go to the labels section and add node-name with label name 
so, when certain requirements like only windows, linux amd, arm came from developers 1st i add label in node and in pod i will add node selector
