ImagePullBackoff
ImagePullBackoff can be caused if the pod runs with an invalid image or typo in the image name or even a non-existent image.
When a kubelet starts creating containers for a Pod using a container runtime, it might be possible the container is in Waiting state because of ImagePullBackOff.
The status ImagePullBackOff means that a container could not start because Kubernetes could not pull a container image for reasons such as
Invalid image name or
Pulling from a private registry without imagePullSecret.

The BackOff part indicates that Kubernetes will keep trying to pull the image, with an increasing back-off delay.
Kubernetes raises the delay between each attempt until it reaches a compiled-in limit, which is 300 seconds (5 minutes).

CrashLoopBackOff
When you see "CrashLoopBackOff," it means that kubelet is trying to run the container, but it keeps failing and crashing. After crashing, Kubernetes tries to restart the container automatically, but if the 
container keeps failing repeatedly, you end up in a loop of crashes and restarts, thus the term "CrashLoopBackOff."
This situation indicates that something is wrong with the application or the configuration that needs to be fixed.

Misconfigurations
Misconfigurations can encompass a wide range of issues, from incorrect environment variables to improper setup of service ports or volumes. These misconfigurations can prevent the application from starting 
correctly, leading to crashes. For example, if an application expects a certain environment variable to connect to a database and that variable is not set or is incorrect, the application might crash as it cannot 
establish a database connection.

Errors in the Liveness Probes
Liveness probes in Kubernetes are used to check the health of a container. If a liveness probe is incorrectly configured, it might falsely report that the container is unhealthy, causing Kubernetes to kill and 
restart the container repeatedly. For example, if the liveness probe checks a URL or port that the application does not expose or checks too soon before the application is ready, the container will be repeatedly 
terminated and restarted.

The Memory Limits Are Too Low
If the memory limits set for a container are too low, the application might exceed this limit, especially under load, leading to the container being killed by Kubernetes. This can happen repeatedly if the workload 
does not decrease, causing a cycle of crashing and restarting. Kubernetes uses these limits to ensure that containers do not consume all available resources on a node, which can affect other containers.
